jQuery.Wishlist
===============

A simple jquery plugin for manage a wishlist with cookies and without registration needed.

### Current Version: 1.0 Beta

Requirements
---------------------

*Wishlist* need some library for works 100%, in the future we wont to create a light versione without this libs, but today for boost the developent of the plug-in we need it.

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery Home") (> 1.8 raccomanded)
* [Underscore JS](http://underscorejs.org/ "Underscore Home")
* [Backbone JS](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone Home")
* [JSON2](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js "Json2 GitHub")

What can we do?
---------------------

With *Wishlist* you can crate a simple bar or button (or as u like) who save some page information into a cookie for create a simple wishlist (or reminder, or chart, ...).
Use cookies? **Yes!** Why? Because, today all mayor site (like FB o bigG) need that the client accept Cookies an so... why not exploit it?
It's an alternative to the registration, **a simple way to do a complex thing**.
**Backbone**, why? Because it allows me to have the very useful tools for the development, which, MVC architecture and a system of Route.
Collections and models in Backbone allow to manipulate the information with smart end powerfull tools, like filtering, ordering, ecc... and in the future allow the possibility to integrate with a server side app.
It's a jQuery plugin only because it's friendly for more Dev that backbone only but in the future maybe I use jQuery only for the View.

Do and To do list:
---------------------

- Create the plugin Core 1.0 Beta Versione

This is a beta version, developed for future needs. There are a lot of things to do, such as:

- Light Version (whitout Backbone & Underscore)
